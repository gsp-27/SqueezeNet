### SqueezeNet

This repository implements squeezenet architecture as described in the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07360v4.pdf "SqueezeNet")

It implements the second model mentioned in the macroarchitecture considerations of the paper. Specifically it has shortcut connections at layer 3,5,7,9 to facilitate residual learning and regularization.
